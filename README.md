# Cisco Packet Tracer Implementation
**Overview**
This repository contains the configuration files and documentation for a comprehensive computer networks project implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer during the 5th semester. 
The project involves the design and configuration of a complex network with multiple blocks, incorporating various routing protocols, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and security measures.

**Project Structure**
The project is organized into four blocks.

The following steps were performed to implement the network:

**1. VLSM Configuration**
Utilized Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) to efficiently allocate IP addresses based on the given number of required hosts per subnet for each group.

**2. Routing Protocols**
Used OSPF with area 1 in the second block, RIP in the third block, and OSPF with area 0 in the last block.
EIGRP was implemented in the first block for routing.

**3. Redistribution**
Configured redistribution on Router8 and Router21 to connect OSPF with OSPF and OSPF with RIP.

**4. DHCP Configuration**
Configured DHCP servers to allocate IP addresses to hosts in OSPF area 1 and RIP.
Hosts in OSPF area 0 obtained IP addresses from "DHCP Server for VLAN's."

**5. NAT Implementation**
Implemented NAT on a designated router with Network G, using the provided public IP address for translation.

**6. VLAN Configuration**
Created VLANs as specified in the scenario.
Configured VTP, designating the 3560 switch as the server and others as clients. The 3560 switch acts as a multi-level switch.

**7. Inter-VLAN Communication**
Established Inter-VLAN communication between VLAN 20 and VLAN 40 using router-on-a-stick technique.

**8. Security Measures**
Implemented IP security between every router in the network.

**9. Access Control**
Configured access control to restrict specific hosts' access to TFTP server, Data server, and other designated hosts.

**10. Routing for VLANs**
Implemented VLAN routing using the router-on-a-stick technique.

## Instructions for Running the Simulation
